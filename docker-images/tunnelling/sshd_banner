You are successfully connected to the challenge.
An isolated service has been forwarded to the localhost port you specified.

You should leave this terminal open while interacting with the service.
When this session is closed (by pressing Ctrl+C), you will be disconnected,
and any writes to the underlying filesystem of the service will be discarded.

Note: This session will automatically close after two hours, at which point you
will be required to reconnect.
